# CSI::Ruby

Anonymized code taken from a real production application.

The real meat is in `v1.rb`, `sharing.rb`, and `tinyurl.rb`.

`e_card` and `email` are simplified stubs included only to make
the controller run.

## Gossip

The original code had two bugs in it which were the least interesting
thing about it. I fixed those so that the code can be savoured properly.

I retrofitted some tests. More like observations, really.

Enjoy.

## Rewrite

The rewrite directory will provide a sample vanilla TDD implementation
of the functionality based on the assumptions present in the original code.

Note that `ECard` and `Email` remain unchanged.
